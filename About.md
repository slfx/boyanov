# Introduction #

This is a personal project. Here I put a code that I write for my personal needs and that sometimes becomes part of other project that I participate.

I was looking for a place to store some of the code that I write from time to time. There are may hosting services offering storage for open source projects but I found this place quite convenient so I decided to create a page here.

Another reason to make that choice was that here is offered Mercurial version control, I thought that it is time to start using on of the distributed version control system.
